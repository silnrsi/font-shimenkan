Shimenkan

The Shimenkan family of fonts supports the broad variety of writing systems that use the Miao (Pollard) script. Eight language-specific font families are part of the project, each reflecting the particular preferences of that language community.

- Salaowu - for Wuding-Luquan Yi / Black Yi [ywqa]
- Sapushan - for Large Flowery Miao [hmd]
- Shimenkan Guifan - alternate for Large Flowery Miao [hmdd]
- Shimenkan GSM - for Gepo / Baiyi [ygp]
- Shimenkan MAS - for Small Flowery Miao [sfm]
- Shimenkan MGS - for Sinicized Miao [hmz] 
- Shimenkan Zonghe - for Aluo / Gan Yi / Laka / Niluo / Yala [yna]
- Taogu - for Lipo [lpo]
(these language names need checking!)

The Latin glyphs are based on the OFL-licensed Source Sans Pro fonts (https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro). The Miao glyphs are designed to harmonize with the Latin, but remain true to the unique characteristics of Miao writing systems. The project is inspired by, but not based on, the Miao Unicode project (https://github.com/phjamr/MiaoUnicode).
