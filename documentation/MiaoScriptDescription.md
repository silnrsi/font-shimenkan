# Miao Script Description

## Summary

This document describes the Miao (Pollard) script and its use for various languages. It specifically describes the script as is implemented in the Shimenkan family of fonts. Alternate script models, historical or contemporary, may disagree with this document and with the way that the script is implemented in this project. Language community preferences reflect the opinions of users interested in using the fonts, which may not necessarily be representative of the whole community. In some cases these opinions (and fonts) depart from documented historical traditions.

## Assumptions



## Syllable structure

Words are made with syllables, and each syllable is independent and does not visually interact with other syllables. The possible syllable structure contains three to six components, each represented by a single Unicode value:

consonant [aspiration] vowel [secondvowel] [thirdvowel] tone

This can be abbreviated to:

C [asp] V [V] [V] T

The following sections describe each component and how different language communities prefer them to be written.

### Consonants

Consonants normally fit within a rectangular space with a constant height. They do not extend above or below the rectangle. There are five types of consonant forms:

#### Standard consonants


### Vowels / Finals


### Tone

Tone is visually indicated by the position of the vowel in relation to the consonant, although it has a discrete Unicode value.


### Aspiration


## Additional symbols

### Numerals


### Punctuation


### Latin
